(1) Rename this repo as "RobustUKF"
    - Use the "asinh" trick
(2) Separate "GaussianState" from the models
    - kalman_filter!(state, model, u, y), look at the LowLevelParticleFilters API
    - Special rules apply to models with immutable states and covariances
    - Use square-root form if P is a cholesky decomposition
    - Immutable states with a cholesky P may be best performance
(3) Add the ability to dispatch on non square-root forms
    - Parameterize the matrices
    - Use Cholesky decompositions instead of triangular forms
